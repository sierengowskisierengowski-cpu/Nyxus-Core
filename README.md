# Nyxus-Core

Canonical source repository for the NYXUS platform and NYX image pipeline.

**Terminology standard**
- **NYX**: the bootable ISO image artifact only.
- **NYXUS**: the operating system, platform services, and application ecosystem delivered by NYX.

---

## System Overview

Nyxus-Core contains the end-to-end platform implementation:
- Arch-based image construction for **NYX**
- Core runtime payloads and desktop assets for **NYXUS**
- API and web distribution surfaces
- Shared TypeScript packages and automation scripts

The repository is intentionally organized as a pnpm workspace so application, service, and shared-library changes can be versioned and shipped together.

---

## Architecture at a Glance

NYXUS is delivered through three coordinated layers:

1. **Build-time**
   - Workspace typechecking and package builds (`lib/*`, `artifacts/*`, `scripts`)
   - API server bundling and dist payload generation
2. **Distribution-time**
   - API and web surfaces distribute installers, tarballs, and related assets
   - ISO staging mirrors runtime payloads into the archiso profile
3. **Runtime**
   - NYX boots into NYXUS runtime components: Hyprland + EWW bars + full GTK4 app suite + NYXUS Phantom

See `/docs/architecture/architecture-overview.md` for component relationships and responsibility boundaries.

## Build and Deployment Summary

### Workspace validation
- `pnpm run typecheck`
- `pnpm run build`

### API/Web packaging flow
- API server build produces distribution outputs under `artifacts/api-server/dist/`
- Vite-based web artifacts use environment-based ports/base paths (see deployment docs)

### NYX ISO flow
- Build host requirement: Arch Linux + root + `mkarchiso`
- Entry point: `iso-builder/build-iso.sh`
- Output artifact: `iso-builder/out/nyx-<version>-x86_64.iso`

Operational detail is documented in `/docs/deployment/*`.

| **Total** | **112,905** |

### Handwritten creator code total

- **Handwritten by Joseph Sierengowski (creator declaration):** **112,905 LOC**

### Measurement method

- Count source lines from tracked code files (`.py`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.sh`, `.yuck`, `.scss`, `.css`, `.qml`).
- Exclude generated/output/vendor paths (for example: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `attached_assets/`, `artifacts/_tmp/`, `iso-builder/out/`).
- Recalculate this snapshot whenever major build content changes.

## Created by Joseph Sierengowski

Nyxus-Core, NYX, and NYXUS were created, architected, and built by **Joseph Sierengowski**.

Joseph serves as the original system designer and primary platform architect, defining the repository's direction across ISO engineering, runtime composition, application integration, and delivery workflow.
