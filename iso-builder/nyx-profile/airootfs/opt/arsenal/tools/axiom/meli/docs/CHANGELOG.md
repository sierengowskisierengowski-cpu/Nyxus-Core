**Classification Engine**
- 16 built-in rules (INFO through CRITICAL)
- YAML rule definition with conditions (eq, in, regex, exists, gte, lte)
- User-defined rules via the Alert Rules UI
- Context injection: attacker_event_count for threshold rules

**IP Enrichment (6 services)**
- MaxMind GeoLite2 — offline city + ASN (no API limit)
- AbuseIPDB — abuse confidence score
- GreyNoise — noise/malicious/benign classification
- VirusTotal — IP + file hash reputation
- Shodan — open ports, CVEs, banners
- IPInfo — ASN, org, VPN/proxy/Tor detection
- 24h result caching in SQLite (configurable TTL)

**Alert System**
- 7 notification channels: Desktop, Discord, Slack, Telegram, SMTP Email, HTTP Webhook, Sound
- Per-rule cooldown, active hours, severity threshold
- Alert sound per severity level (PipeWire/ALSA via paplay/aplay)

- Formats: PDF (ReportLab), Markdown, JSON, CSV
- Jinja2 report templates

**Database**
- SQLite via SQLAlchemy 2.x
- WAL journal mode, foreign keys enabled

- Online backup via SQLite backup API
- VACUUM support

**GTK4 Views (14)**
1. Dashboard — stat cards, severity breakdown, top attackers, recent events, honeypot health
2. Live Feed — real-time MQTT event stream, pause/filter/export
3. Geographic Map — world map with Leaflet.js (WebKitGTK) + country table
4. Attackers — sortable IP table with enrichment profile drawer
5. Credentials — username/password pairs with wordlist export
6. Commands — post-auth command analysis with intent classification
7. Payloads — captured malware with VirusTotal hash lookup
8. Service Stats — per-honeypot breakdown with health status
9. Timeline — attack volume bars with configurable periods (1h/24h/7d/30d/90d)
10. IP Reputation — single-IP lookup across all enrichment services
11. Botnet Detection — coordinated attack cluster analysis
12. Alert Rules — CRUD editor + alert history with acknowledge
13. Reports — generate and browse reports
14. Settings — full configuration panel (categories sidebar)

**Security**
- Fernet encryption (AES-128-CBC) for API keys and sensitive data at rest

- Database and config files: chmod 600 / 700
- API keys never logged or stored in config file plaintext

**Packaging**
- `install.sh` — Arch/Ubuntu/Fedora support, phased install
