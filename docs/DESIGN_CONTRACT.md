# NYXUS Design Contract

**Version 1 · 2026-05-11 · rev r9-eww**

This is the **single quality bar** for everything in NYXUS — every panel,
flyout, window, dialog, menu, page, and overlay. Old work and new work
both. If something fails this contract, it's a bug — file it, don't ship it.

The benchmark is **macOS Sonoma / Windows 11 / iOS 17**. Not "indie Linux."

---

## 1. Layout & Fit

> **No content stuck to the top with a gap below. No content overflowing the edges. Nothing pushed off-screen on a laptop display.**

- Every panel must be **vertically centered** in its viewport unless the
  content genuinely fills it. Use a flex spacer above and below an inner
  column, **not** padding-top alone.
- Every panel must have a **hard max-width** for body text/labels.
  Default: title ≤ 760px, body copy ≤ 720px. Never let a paragraph
  stretch across an ultrawide monitor.
- Every panel must have a **min-width** so it doesn't collapse on small
  screens. Default: 480px.
- Every panel must work at **1366×768** (the smallest display we support)
  without clipping the footer or hiding any control.
- If content might overflow, wrap it in a `Gtk.ScrolledWindow` /
  EWW `scroll` widget with a fixed `height`. Never let a window grow
  unbounded.
- Footer/toolbar always anchored at the bottom edge. Primary action
  always on the right. Back/secondary always on the left.
- **Test on every breakpoint before merging:** 1366×768, 1920×1080, 2560×1440, 3840×2160.

## 2. Spacing

- Outer panel padding: **18-24px** (small flyouts) or **56-72px** (full-screen apps).
- Section spacing: **14-20px** vertical between distinct groups.
- Tight spacing (label → input): **6-10px**.
- Never use `0px` spacing between sibling elements unless they visually
  belong to the same component (e.g. a button group).

## 3. Typography

| Use                         | Family                       | Size | Weight | Tracking |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|------|--------|----------|
| Display headline            | Space Grotesk / Inter        | 44px | 700    | -0.01em  |
| Section title               | Inter                        | 22px | 700    | 0.18em   |
| Body                        | Inter                        | 14px | 400    | normal   |
| Eyebrow / label             | Inter                        | 11px | 600    | 0.20-0.32em |
| Hint / metadata             | Inter                        | 11px | 400    | normal   |
| Mono (code, IDs, glyph nums)| JetBrainsMono Nerd Font      | 11-14px | 400 | normal   |

- All caps **only** for eyebrows, labels, section headers. Never for body.
- Never use system-default font fallback in production. If the font is
  missing, install it.

## 4. Color

DARK MIRROR palette is locked. Do **not** invent new colors.

| Token             | Value                          | Use                            |
|-------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `--bg-page`       | `#000000` to `#050608` gradient| Window background              |
| `--surface-1`     | `rgba(8,10,16,0.66)`           | Rails, sidebars                |
| `--surface-2`     | `rgba(17,21,31,0.85)`          | Inputs, list rows              |
| `--accent-primary`| `#a06bff` (Mirror purple)      | Primary actions, focus         |
| `--accent-secondary`| `#3ad8ff` (Mirror cyan)      | Gradient pair                  |
| `--success`       | `#82ffd2`                      | Confirmations, "done" state    |
| `--warning`       | `#ffb45e`                      | Pending, caution               |
| `--danger`        | `#ff4d6b`                      | Errors, destructive            |
| `--text-strong`   | `#ffffff`                      | Headings, primary copy         |
| `--text`          | `#e8edf5`                      | Body                           |
| `--text-muted`    | `#9aa2b3` / `#8b94a8`          | Hints, captions                |
| `--text-subtle`   | `#6b7388`                      | Eyebrows, footnotes            |
| `--text-faint`    | `#3a4055`                      | Disabled                       |

- Use the gradient `linear-gradient(90deg, #a06bff, #3ad8ff)` for primary
  buttons and progress fills only. Don't sprinkle it on cards.
- Never use saturated red/green/yellow at full brightness. The danger
  token is muted on purpose.

## 5. Borders, radii, and shadows

- Border radius: **10px** (inputs, small buttons), **12px** (cards, tiles),
  **16px** (windows, large panels), **999px** (pills, slider tracks).
- Default border: `1px solid rgba(160,107,255,0.10-0.32)` (intensity tracks
  the hierarchy of the surface).
- Focus ring: `border-color: #3ad8ff; box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(58,216,255,0.18);`
- Window shadow: `0 24px 60px rgba(0,0,0,0.70)` plus inner highlight
  `inset 0 0 28px rgba(160,107,255,0.06)`.
- Never use a hard `1px solid black` border — always use the purple/cyan
  family at low alpha.

## 6. Motion

- All transitions: **160-220ms**, ease-out or ease-in-out only.
- Page transitions: cross-fade (Gtk.StackTransitionType.CROSSFADE) or
  slide-then-fade. Never instant.
- Hover/focus state changes: 120-180ms.
- No bouncing, no spring overshoot, no carnival animations.

## 7. Inputs

- Every text input: 12-14px padding, 10px radius, focus ring per §5.
- Every dropdown: same chrome as text inputs.
- Every switch: gradient when on, neutral grey when off, white knob.
- Every slider: thin track (5-6px), gradient highlight, white knob with
  glow.
- Validation: **inline below the field**, not in a popup. Red text only,
  no icons unless the design includes them by default.
- Required fields: never marked with red asterisks. Use a soft hint or
  rely on the validator.

## 8. Buttons

| Variant   | Use                         | Style                                     |
|-----------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Primary   | The single main action      | Gradient fill, dark text, glow on hover   |
| Ghost     | Secondary actions           | Transparent, purple border, white on hover|
| Link      | Tertiary / "skip" / "advanced" | No border, muted text, white on hover  |
| Destructive | Delete, forget, sign out  | Red-tinted ghost; solid red only on confirm dialogs |

- One primary per panel. If you need two, one of them is wrong.
- Never use emoji as a button label substitute. Glyphs (✕, ↻, ◉) are okay.

## 9. Empty / loading / error states

- Every list, every grid, every panel must define what it shows when:
  1. **Empty** — short copy + a primary action ("Connect to WiFi", not just "No networks")
  2. **Loading** — skeleton or spinner placed where the content would be
  3. **Error** — short copy + retry button + advanced action (open logs)
- Never show a blank panel. Never throw a stack trace into the UI.

## 10. Copy

- Sentence case. Not Title Case.
- Active voice. Second person. ("Pick your accent." not "Accent Selection")
- No exclamation marks unless on a single celebratory moment per app.
- No "click here." Buttons say what they do.

## 11. Accessibility

- Minimum contrast: **4.5:1** for body text, **3:1** for large text.
- All interactive elements ≥ **40×40px** target on touch displays.
- Every input has a label (visible or `aria-label`).
- Focus is always visible. Never `outline: none` without a replacement.
- Keyboard: every action reachable with Tab + Enter. Esc closes flyouts.

## 12. Per-component checklists

### Flyouts (EWW windows)

- [ ] Geometry uses `:anchor "bottom right"` (or matching corner), `:y "78"` to clear bar
- [ ] Has explicit `:width` and `:height` (or `"auto"` for height only)
- [ ] Inner padding 18-20px, root border-radius 16px
- [ ] Title at top, content middle, action row at bottom
- [ ] Close button in action row labelled "Close (Esc)"
- [ ] List content wrapped in `scroll` with fixed `:height`
- [ ] Empty state defined (e.g. "No paired devices")
- [ ] Namespace starts with `nyxus-` so layerblur catch-all picks it up

### Wizards / multi-step flows

- [ ] Step rail on left with current/done/upcoming states
- [ ] Stage content vertically AND horizontally centered in viewport
- [ ] Footer pinned to bottom with Back (left) / Continue (right)
- [ ] Continue disabled when current step's validation fails
- [ ] Each step's commit() applies real system state — no mockups
- [ ] Marker file written on completion so it never re-runs

### Settings panes

- [ ] Sidebar nav on left with icon + label
- [ ] Pane title at top, eyebrow above
- [ ] Settings grouped into named sections with 14px spacing
- [ ] Every toggle/dropdown writes immediately on change (no Save button)
- [ ] Search bar in shell finds settings by name AND keyword

### Dialogs

- [ ] Adw.MessageDialog or matching style
- [ ] Title sentence case
- [ ] Body 1-2 short paragraphs, no walls of text
- [ ] Two-button max (Cancel left, Action right). Three only with reason.
- [ ] Destructive actions in danger color

## 13. Audit trail (existing components)

Every component built before this contract was written must be audited
against §1-12. Score each as PASS / NEEDS-FIX / FAIL.

| Component                       | Status                 | Notes |

| Notification Center             | PASS (audited 2026-05-11) | Empty state added: DND-aware ("All caught up" / "DND on") |
| Cheatsheet                      | PASS (audited 2026-05-11) | Title + 3 cols + close button + Esc — no list = no empty state needed |
| Powermenu                       | PASS (audited 2026-05-11) | Added `.power-btn-danger` variant: Shutdown/Restart now red-bordered with red glyph (§8) |
| Dashboard                       | PASS (audited 2026-05-11) | Wrapped in `(scroll …)` so content never overflows 1366×768 (§12); replaced all 8 emoji toggles with nerd-font glyphs (§6) |
| Welcome Wizard                  | PASS (built to contract) | Reference implementation |
| Settings app                    | PASS (rev r11 — full build) | libadwaita Adw.NavigationSplitView, 17 sections all fully wired with real backends: Appearance (swww/hyprctl), Network (nmcli), Bluetooth (bluetoothctl), Display (hyprctl monitors + brightnessctl + night-light), Sound (pactl sinks/sources/mute/default), Power (battery + powerprofilesctl + cpufreq governor + logind), Notifications (mako/dunst/swaync auto-detect + DND + history), Date/Time (timedatectl + tz picker + world clock), Keyboard (hyprctl input:kb_* + repeat rate/delay), Mouse (sensitivity + accel + natural scroll + touchpad), Privacy (camera/mic detection + active-capture watch + geoclue + telemetry audit), Apps (pacman + xdg-mime defaults + autostart), Storage (df + lsblk + smartctl + paccache + journal vacuum), Updates (checkupdates + paru/yay -Qua + reboot-required check), Accessibility (text scale + cursor size + animations toggle), Users (whoami + getent + sessions + visudo). Every page either has live data or an honest §9 empty state. Live polling on Display/Sound/Power/Storage/Updates with cleanup on window close. EWW dashboard gear tile (󰒓) launches `nyxus-settings`. |
| SysMon app                      | PASS (audited 2026-05-12) | Refactored to `Adw.Application` + `Adw.ApplicationWindow` + `Adw.NavigationSplitView` with `Adw.HeaderBar` carrying live host/uptime/procs/clock pills. All 8 Cairo content pages preserved (Overview, CPU, Memory, Disk, Network, GPU, Processes, Sensors). FORCE_DARK color scheme. §9 honored on every page (sensors falls back to "no readings" copy when lm_sensors empty). |
| Notepad app                     | PASS (built to contract) | Standalone `Adw.ApplicationWindow` markdown editor + Pango-rendered preview pane via `Gtk.Paned`, file open/save/save-as via `Gtk.FileDialog`, recent files menu with §9 "No recent files" empty state, 2s debounced autosave, restore-last-session, Ctrl+N/O/S/Shift-S/P shortcuts, `Adw.MessageDialog` discard confirm. FORCE_DARK. |
| Stickies app                    | PASS (audited 2026-05-12) | Cairo paper-note canvas (intentional creative aesthetic) wrapped in `Adw.Application` + FORCE_DARK so it boots and themes consistently with the rest of the family. JSON persistence, drag-to-reposition, color-picker per note, double-click to edit. |
| Notes app                       | PASS (audited 2026-05-12) | Lightweight scratchpad: `Adw.Application` + FORCE_DARK + dirty-state save indicator with §9 empty state for first-run. |
| Control app                     | PASS (audited 2026-05-12) | Tactile Cairo control surface (HW profile + fan curves + RGB + processes + profiles) wrapped in `Adw.Application` + FORCE_DARK. All 6 nav pages render; toast surface for live actions. |
| Launcher                        | PASS (audited 2026-05-12) | Rofi-style fuzzy app launcher: `Adw.Application` + FORCE_DARK, `.desktop` scan + fuzzy match scoring, keyboard-driven (Up/Down/Enter/Esc), §9 "No matches" empty state. |
| Terminal app                    | PASS (audited 2026-05-12) | VTE-backed terminal: `Adw.Application` + FORCE_DARK; honest fallback label when VTE GTK4 binding (`vte-2.91-gtk4`) is missing rather than a blank window. |
| Screenshot picker               | PASS (audited 2026-05-12) | Region/full-screen `grim`+`slurp` wrapper: `Adw.Application` + FORCE_DARK, decorated borderless window with chrome glow, mode picker. |
| Screensaver                     | PASS (audited 2026-05-12) | Fullscreen Cairo screensaver: `Adw.Application` + FORCE_DARK, SIGTERM/SIGINT honored so `hypridle` can wake cleanly. |
| Welcome Wizard                  | PASS (rev r13 — Adw audit 2026-05-12) | `Adw.ApplicationWindow` + step-rail wizard (Hello → Region → Network → Account → Appearance → Privacy → Ready). `Adw.MessageDialog` for confirms. Region populated from `timedatectl` + curated tz list, network from `nmcli`. Reference implementation for the family. |
| Doctor (CLI)                    | PASS (audited 2026-05-12) | Single-shot health audit — intentionally CLI (no GTK), uses NYXUS palette tokens for colored terminal report. Exits 0 (green) / 1 (yellow or red). Listed in APPS_LIST as a terminal launcher. |
| Fog overlay                     | PASS (audited 2026-05-12) | Layer-shell Cairo fog drifting around bar edges: `Adw.Application` + FORCE_DARK. **Launch blocker fixed**: `FogBlob.__init__` referenced an undefined `COLOR_GOLD` token (palette only ships white/off-white/grey wisps) — branch removed; alpha now uses the single bright-fog range. |
| Demon Wake (jumpscare)          | PASS (audited 2026-05-12) | Lock/wake jumpscare overlay: `Adw.Application` + FORCE_DARK; SIGTERM/SIGINT honored, hard-kill timer ensures it always exits even if fade glitches. |
| App Store                       | PASS (built to contract 2026-05-12) | New `nyxus_store.py` — Settings-style `Adw.NavigationSplitView` with sidebar sections **Featured / Installed / Updates / Search / Repositories / About**. Curated 12-app featured list with one-click install (auto-marks "Installed" for already-present packages). Installed = `pacman -Qe` with Remove. Updates = `checkupdates` (or `pacman -Qu` fallback) + `paru/yay -Qua` + `flatpak remote-ls --updates`, with Update-All bar per backend. Search = debounced 350ms across pacman + AUR + flatpak (capped 60/backend). Privilege model: pacman install/remove/upgrade goes through `pkexec pacman …` (root-required); AUR helpers (paru/yay) deliberately run as the invoking user — `paru/yay` will internally `sudo`/`pkexec` for the pacman portion, since AUR build steps must NOT run as root; flatpak runs at user scope (no pkexec) by default. Every command is launched inside a terminal window (alacritty/kitty/foot/wezterm/xterm fallback chain) so polkit prompts and conflict prompts are visible. Honest §9 empty states everywhere ("Everything is up to date", "No matches", "No AUR helper installed"). Backend matrix in About shows `pacman / checkupdates / paru-yay / flatpak / pkexec` availability. `NYXUS_DRY_RUN=1` for safe testing. |
| Power Menu (standalone)         | PASS (built to contract 2026-05-12) | New `nyxus_powermenu.py` — standalone `Adw.ApplicationWindow` replacing the legacy `nyxus_powermenu.py` slot that the EWW overlay had stolen. 6 tactile tiles in a 3×2 grid: Lock (`hyprlock` → `loginctl lock-session` fallback), Suspend (`systemctl suspend`), Logout (`hyprctl dispatch exit`), Restart, Shutdown, Cancel. Restart/Shutdown/Logout gate behind `Adw.MessageDialog` confirm with destructive styling. Esc dismisses. `NYXUS_DRY_RUN=1` honored. EWW powermenu overlay (Super+Esc) stays — the standalone app is for menu/launcher invocation. |
| App family Adw consistency      | PASS (audited 2026-05-12) | All 13 GUI Python apps in `nyxus-scripts/` — notepad, stickies, notes, sysmon_gtk, settings, control, terminal, launcher, screenshot, **store**, **powermenu**, screensaver, welcome, fog, demon_wake — subclass `Adw.Application`, call `Adw.init()`, and force `Adw.ColorScheme.FORCE_DARK` on activate. Same shared `nyxus_chrome` graffiti background + `nyxus_palette` tokens. Doctor stays CLI by design. `APPS_LIST` in `iso-builder/build-iso.sh` cleaned: phantom `weather`/`quicksettings` entries removed (those live in EWW), duplicate `settings:` collapsed, `notes` + `store` + `powermenu` entries added. Every entry maps to a real `nyxus_<mod>.py`. The Download Portal at `nyxus-web` exposes the full inventory at hash route `#/build` so the build can be inspected without booting the ISO. |

Audit pass: walk every component on a 1366×768 display. Anything that
fails ships a fix in the same sprint as the audit.

---

## 14. Process

- Every PR/commit that adds or changes UI **must** include a screenshot
  on at least 1366×768 and 1920×1080.
- No "we'll fix the polish later." Polish is shipping criteria, not
  follow-up work.
- If you can't make it look like Apple/Microsoft would ship it, file a
  blocker before merging.
